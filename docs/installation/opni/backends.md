An observability backend is where observability data is sent for storage and querying. Backends are configured in the Opni Management UI.
You can currently create the following backends:

:::note

For the best user experience consider using Google-Chrome.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="opni-monitoring" label="Opni Monitoring" default>

The Monitoring backend is composed of [Cortex](https://cortexmetrics.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) deployments, fully managed by Opni.
You can enable and configure Monitoring from the Opni dashboard, or from the CLI.

## Using the Opni Dashboard

Follow these steps to enable Monitoring from the Opni dashboard:

1. Navigate to the Opni dashboard.

To access the dashboard, you can port-forward:

```bash
kubectl -n opni port-forward svc/opni-admin-dashboard web:web
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:12080](http://localhost:12080).

2. Select "Monitoring" from the left sidebar under "Backends", then click "Enable".

  <div className="image-border">
    <img
      src={require('/img/installation/monitoring-not-installed.png').default} 
      alt="Monitoring not installed"
    />
  </div>

3. Adjust configuration options as needed:

<div className="image-border">
  <img
    src={require('/img/installation/monitoring-install-options.png').default} 
    alt="Monitoring configuration"
  />
</div>

  <br />
  <br />

### Mode

    - **Standalone**: All components of Cortex will be deployed in a single pod. This is suitable for small setups.

    - **Highly Available**: Cortex components will be deployed in separate pods and replicated for high availability. This setup can provide better performance and reliability, but requires more resources.

### Storage Type

    - **S3**: Cortex will store time series data in an S3 bucket. This is the recommended default option.

    - **Filesystem**: Cortex will store time series data on the local filesystem using a persistent volume. This option is suitable for testing and demo setups.

    :::caution

    Filesystem storage may be unreliable, especially during upgrades. Do not rely on this option for production workloads, as data loss is possible.

    :::

### Data Retention Period

Controls the global retention period for time series data.

:::note

Cortex stores historical data in blocks, where each block contains 2 hours worth of data. Blocks are scanned periodically, and any blocks which contain metrics older than the retention period will be deleted.

:::

### S3 Options

    When S3 storage is selected, the following options are available (required fields will be marked with a <span style={{ color: '#f00' }}>*</span> in the Opni UI):

    - **Bucket Name**: The name of the S3 bucket to use for storing time series data. This bucket must already exist.

    - **Endpoint**: The S3 endpoint to use. Selecting a region from the dropdown will automatically populate this field with the appropriate AWS S3 endpoint, or a custom endpoint can be provided.

    - **Access Key ID**: The access key ID to use for authenticating with S3.

    - **Secret Access Key**: The secret access key to use for authenticating with S3.

    - **Signature Version**: The signature version to use for authenticating with S3. This should be set to `v4` for AWS S3.

    - **Server Side Encryption**: This can be enabled if your S3 bucket is configured to use server side encryption. If `SSE-KMS` is selected, you will be required to provide the KMS Key ID and Encryption Context.

    - **Connection**: Various connection options can be specified. The default options are sufficient for most use cases.

### Grafana

Grafana can be enabled by clicking "Enable" under the Grafana section. The following configuration options are available:

    - **Hostname**: The hostname at which Grafana will be accessed in the browser.

    :::info

    To access Grafana from a browser, you will need to create a Kubernetes Ingress for the Grafana service. This hostname must match the hostname configured in the ingress.

    :::

Once Grafana is enabled, access it in the browser to view the Opni dashboards. Several pre-configured dashboards are available.

![Grafana](/img/installation/grafana-default-dashboard.png)

## Using the CLI

Opening a shell into the Opni Gateway pod will give you access to an auto-configured CLI environment.

```bash
kubectl -n opni exec -it deploy/opni-gateway -- sh
```

The `opni metrics ops` subcommand can be used to configure the Monitoring backend.

```bash
$ opni metrics ops --help

## Access Control

Opni Monitoring uses Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to control which clusters a given user is allowed to see. If you are familiar with RBAC in Kubernetes, it works the same way.

In Kubernetes, RBAC rules are used to determine which API resources a given User or Service Account is allowed to access. Similarly, in Opni Monitoring, RBAC rules are used to determine which clusters a user has access to. When a user makes an authenticated query, the system will evaluate the current RBAC rules for that user and determine which clusters to consider when running the query.

### Labels

Clusters in Opni Monitoring have an opaque ID and can have a number of key-value labels. Labels are the primary means of identifying clusters for access control purposes. Labels in Opni Monitoring are functionally similar to labels in Kubernetes, and follow these rules:

- Labels must have unique keys, and there is a one-to-one mapping between keys and values.
- Labels cannot have empty keys or values
- Label keys must match the following regular expression:

  ```
  ^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_./]{0,63}$
  ```

- Label values must match the following regular expression:

  ```
  ^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_.]{0,63}$
  ```

### Roles

A role is a named object representing a set of permissions. It contains rules that match clusters by ID or by the cluster's labels. A role can use any/all of the following matchers:

##### 1. Label Matchers

A role can match clusters by specifying an explicit `key=value` label pair that will match a single label with the exact key and value specified. No partial matching or globbing is performed.

##### 2. Label Selector Expressions

A role can also match clusters by using a Kubernetes-style label selector. These selectors are more versatile, and can match labels using a variety of rules, such as:

- Matching if a given key exists
- Matching if a given key does not exist
- Matching if the value for a given key is in a list of allowed values
- Matching if the value for a given key is not in a list of allowed values

##### 3. Explicit Cluster IDs

Clusters can also be explicitly added to a role by ID. It is not recommended to use explicit cluster IDs as a primary means of access control, but they can be useful in situations where you want to add an exception to an existing role or a temporary override. Label-based selectors are much more flexible, and should be preferred in general.

### Role Bindings

A role binding is a named object that attaches one or more users ("subjects") to a role. When evaluating RBAC rules for a given user, the system will look up all role bindings attached to that user, then use the union of the associated roles to determine which clusters the user is allowed to see.

<br />

## Configuring Roles and Role Bindings

### Using the Opni Dashboard

Roles and Role Bindings can be configured in the **RBAC** section under Monitoring in the left sidebar.

#### Creating Roles

On the Roles page, click the **Create Role** button. Give the role a unique name, then add clusters by ID, or by label selector. Existing clusters will be listed in the dropdown menu when adding clusters by ID to the role.

<div className="image-border">
  <img
    src={require('/img/installation/rbac-new-role-clusters.png').default} 
    alt="Clusters dropdown"
  />
</div>

<br />
<br />

#### Example Roles

In this example, we will create roles for two different environments, one for "prod" and one for "dev/test", which we will separate our clusters into using labels.

1. Creating the "production" role

<div className="image-border">
<img
    src={require('/img/installation/rbac-example-role-production.png').default} 
    alt="Clusters dropdown"
/>
</div>

2. Creating the "dev" role

<div className="image-border">
<img
    src={require('/img/installation/rbac-example-role-dev.png').default} 
    alt="Clusters dropdown"
/>
</div>

3. Roles list with the new roles

<div className="image-border">
<img
    src={require('/img/installation/rbac-example-roles.png').default} 
    alt="Clusters dropdown"
/>
</div>

#### Creating Role Bindings

To create a role binding, navigate to the **Role Bindings** page in the sidebar.

On the Role Bindings page, Click the **Create Role Binding** button. Give the role binding a unique name, select an existing role to attach to the binding. then add subjects (users) to whom the role will be applied. The value used to identify a user depends on the `identifyingClaim` configured in the Gateway's OAuth settings. For example, if your `identifyingClaim` is `email`, subjects are identified by email address. Check your OAuth provider's documentation to determine which `identifyingClaim` you should use.

#### Example Role Bindings

Following the example above, we will create role bindings for two users, one for each role.

1. Creating a role binding for a "production" user

<div className="image-border">
<img
    src={require('/img/installation/rbac-example-alice.png').default} 
    alt="Clusters dropdown"
/>
</div>

2. Creating a role binding for a "dev" user

<div className="image-border">
<img
    src={require('/img/installation/rbac-example-bob.png').default} 
    alt="Clusters dropdown"
/>
</div>

3. Role bindings list with the new role bindings

<div className="image-border">
<img
    src={require('/img/installation/rbac-example-rolebindings.png').default} 
    alt="Clusters dropdown"
/>
</div>

#### Labeling Clusters for Access Control

To label a cluster, navigate to the **Clusters** page in the sidebar. Right-click on the cluster you want to label, then select **Edit**. Add labels to the cluster, then click **Save**.

<div className="image-border">
  <img
    src={require('/img/installation/rbac-example-label.png').default} 
    alt="Clusters dropdown"
  />
</div>

<br />
<br />

#### Example labels

In this example, we will label our clusters with the environment they are in, "prod", "dev", or "test".

<div className="image-border">
  <img
    src={require('/img/installation/rbac-example-labeled-clusters.png').default} 
    alt="Clusters dropdown"
  />
</div>

<br />
<br />

When a user logs in to Grafana via OAuth, they will only see the clusters they have access to. In this example, Alice will only see the "prod" clusters (4, 5, 6, 7, 8), and Bob will only see the "dev" (1, 2, 3) and "test" (9, 10) clusters.

:::tip Access Matrix

The `opni access-matrix` CLI command will print the access matrix of all users and clusters.

```
$ opni access-matrix

               TENANT ID               alice@example.com  bob@example.com

 dev         environment ∈ {dev,test}  (none)
 production  environment ∈ {prod}      (none)
```

:::note

The CLI does not yet support creating roles with label expression matching, only simple label matching.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="opni-logging" label="Opni Logging">
To enable the Opni Logging backend, select "Logging" under "Backends" in the left hand navigation menu of the Opni Admin UI, and hit the Enable button.  You will be presented with a number of details to fill out.

#### External URL

This is the URL that the Opensearch API will be exposed on, e.g https://opensearch.example.com. You will need to manually expose this URL using either an Ingress or Load Balancer service.

:::note

In some cases it might be simpler to access the Opensarch dashboard with a port-forward

```
kubectl -n opni port-forward svc/opni-opensearch-svc-dashboards 5601:5601
```

:::

#### Data Retention

This is how long logs will be retained for. The default is 7 days (7d). This can be extended if required, for example 6 months (6m) or 1 year (1y).

#### Node Pool configuration

![Opni Node Pool settings](/img/loggingnodepool.png)

This is where the Opensearch node pools are configured. All three roles (controlplane, data, ingest) are required in the cluster but can be spread across multiple node pools.

The roles are as follows:

- **Controlplane** - manages leader elections for the cluster
- **Data** - stores the cluster data and runs indexing and search operations
- **Ingest** - runs ingest pipelines; Opni uses ingest pipelines to set up the data for AI operations.

For large clusters it is recommended to separate the roles. In particular the controlplane nodes should be separated to avoid resource contention affecting the leader elections. There should always be an odd number of controlplane nodes.

In most cases, you will want to deploy at least 3 `Controlpane` to ensure there will be at least one master for the Opensearch cluster.

#### Dashboards configuration.

Click enable to install Opensearch Dashboards. This provides a UI for Opensearch and Opni AIOps.

![Opni Node Pool settings](/img/loggingdashboards.png)

#### Accessing Opensearch Dashboards

Once the Opensearch cluster is reported as ready, you can access the dashboards. Opni will create an admin user that must be used to log in to the dashboards. The username and password admin credentials can be obtained from the `opni-admin-password` secret.

##### Username

```
kubectl get secret -n opni opni-admin-password -o jsonpath='{.data.username}' | base64 -d
```

##### Password

```
kubectl get secret -n opni opni-admin-password -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
```

It is recommended that you change the password on this user.
